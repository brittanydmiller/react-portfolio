				<h3>How Do I Show Respect?</h3>

				<p><img src="images/protest.jpg" alt="GSA kis protesting" class="respect" /></p>
				<h4>Transphobic words</h4>
					<p>Calling someone a Tranny or "Too butch to be a girl” etc. demeans and trivializes the wide variety of experiences held by those who identify as transgender. If you see this type of transphobic language being used, challenge it.</p>

				<h4>Real Name?</h4>
					<p>Asking someone what their ‘real’name is implies that their chosen name is in someway invalid or not ‘real.’ In the same way, asking someone what their ‘real’ gender is disrespects their own gender identity.</p>

				<h4>Coming Out</h4>
					<p>A gender identity is personal. If someone chooses to come out to you as trans* this means they trust you. Make sure to honor that trust by checking with them before telling anyone else as they may not want others to know.</p>

				<h4>Just Ask!</h4>
					<p>It is important to respect the names and pronouns that people prefer. If you are unsure, simply ask, “What are your preferred pronouns?”</p>

				<h3>How are Transgender and Other Gender Non-Conforming Youth Treated at School?</h3>
				<p>In addition to the typical challenges faced by all students, those who are transgender and/or gender non-conforming must also be ready to survive slurs, bullying, harassment, and assaults by fellow students and even teachers. Instead of creating safe spaces for gender non-conforming and transgender students, school administrations often enforce policies and practices that can punish gender non-conforming and transgender youth simply for being who they are. Examples of discrimination based on gender identity, appearance, and behavior include: refusing to allow students to wear clothing that ﬁts their gender identity, denying students access to educational or extra-curricular opportunities due to their actual or perceived gender identity and/or expression, and a school’s failure to protect students from harassment based on their actual or perceived gender identity and/or expression. </p>

				<h4>Harassment:</h4> 
				<p>Students who are transgender or gender non-conforming often face persistent and severe harassment that can involve name-calling, threats of violence, sexual innuendos or sexual harassment, and even physical assault. A recent study of California students found that 53% of students said their schools were not safe for guys who aren’t as masculine as other guys, and 34% of students said their schools were not safe for girls who aren’t as feminine as other girls. Students who are gender non-conforming and/or transgender are often thought to be gay, bisexual, or lesbian (even if they do not identify as any of these), which increases the harassment and/or discrimination that they experience. This is because gender discrimination and harassment is often rooted in homophobia, as gender and sexual orientation are seen as interconnected. </p>

				<h4>Names and Pronouns:</h4>
				<p>Recognizing and validating the names and pronouns that correspond to transgender students’ gender identity is important for their emotional health and well-being. A student’s name appears in a large variety of places -- student records, IDs, class roll-call, school publications, tests, and homework assignments to name just a few. Many transgender students adopt new names that are essential to their identity. They also may request that they be referred to by the pronoun that corresponds, or most closely corresponds, with their gender identity. It is important that these requests be respected.</p>

				<p>Some gender non-conforming students do not change their name or ask to be referred to by a different pronoun. Even for these students, however, names and pronouns can still be used to discriminate against them. For example, some gender non-conforming students are teased through the use of the wrong pronoun or variations of their names. For example, a boy called Juan who is perceived to be effeminate is called “Juanita” to express other students’ beliefs that he is not acting the way a boy “is supposed to act.” This type of name calling or the misuse of an appropriate name or pronoun can be very damaging to a student’s ability to fully engage in, and feel safe at, school.</p>

				<h4>Sex Segregation:</h4>
				<p>Many school environments and some school activities are sex segregated. Examples include restrooms, some physical education activities, some class projects, and some student activities. Such segregation can cause difﬁculties for transgender students if they are not allowed access to those facilities or activities that match their gender identity. Not only can such a denial affect students’ emotional well-being, but in some cases it can also affect their physical well-being. For instance, if transgender students are denied access to the restroom that corresponds with their gender identity, they might avoid using the restroom at school altogether. This can lead to many physical and emotional health problems and can also create and incentive for the student to disengage from school.</p>

				<p>Sex segregation can be especially difﬁcult for transgender students who do not identify as either male or female. If such a student is only presented with the choice of a male or female restroom, the student is forced to make a choice that does not match their gender identity. And often times such a “choice” is meaningless because the student is harassed by other students regardless of whether the student opts to use the male or the female restroom. Harassment in restrooms is a common form of discrimination against gender non-conforming students. Because of transphobia and sex stereotyping, these students are regularly subjected to verbal and physical harassment in restrooms. Therefore, it is important that schools take steps to make sure that restrooms and other sex-segregated spaces be made accessable and safe for students who are transgender and/or gender non-conforming.</p>

				<h4>Dress Codes:</h4>
				<p>Enforcement of dress codes is often a source of discrimination. For example, it would be discriminatory for a school to have a dress code that is different for boys and girls and refuse to allow a transgender student to wear clothing consistent with their gender identity. Sometimes transgender students are even disciplined simply for wearing clothing consistent with their gender identity. Such disciplinary action can negatively affect the student’s standing in the school. In addition, transgender and gender non-conforming students are sometimes held to a different standard than other students. For example, the clothes of young transgender women are often scrutinized more closely than the clothes of other young women. A skirt that is considered “appropriate” when worn by a biological girl is called “inappropriate” when it is worn by a transgender student. Similarly, gender non-conforming students sometimes face harassment or are scrutinized because their clothes are considered “too feminine” or “too masculine.”</p>
