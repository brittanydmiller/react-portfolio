			<h4>Feeling Unsafe at School</h4>
			<ul class="school">
				<li>53% of California students reported that their school is unsafe for “guys who aren’t as masculine as other guys” and 34% reported that their school is unsafe for “girls who aren’t as feminine as other girls.”</li>
				<li>90% of transgender youth surveyed for a nationwide survey reported feeling unsafe at school because of their gender expression.</li>
			</ul class="school">
			<h4>Hearing Negative Comments</h4>
			<ul>
				<li>63% of California students reported that they sometimes or often hear students make negative comments based on gender presentation.</li>
				<li>13% of California students report that they sometimes or often hear teachers make negative comments based on gender presentation.</li>
				<li>Only 40% of California students report that sometimes or often they hear teachers or staff stop others when others make negative comments based on gender presentation.</li>
			</ul>
			<h4>Experiencing Harassment</h4>
			<ul class="school">
				<li>27% of California students report being harassed because they aren’t “masculine enough” or aren’t “feminine enough.”</li>
				<li>55% of transgender youth on a nationwide survey report being physically harassed at school because of their gender expression.</li>
				<li>81% of transgender youth on a nationwide survey reported being sexually harassed at school in the past year because of their gender expression.</li>
			</ul>
			<h4>Improving Protections and Reducing Harassment and Violence</h4>
			<ul class="school">
				<li>California students were less likely to be harassed for gender non-conformity if their school harassment policy included sexual orientation and gender, teachers intervened when negative comments were made, their school had a Gay-Straight Alliance club, and students learned about LGBT issues in school.</li>
				<li>In a recent poll, 95% of youth supported expanding current hate crimes laws to cover gender and sexual orientation.</li>
				<li>In the U.S., 4 states, 52 cities and 9 counties include transgender people in their anti-discrimination laws.  This means that 24% of the U.S. population is protected from discrimination on the basis of gender identity by statute, and 76% are not.</li>

			<p>Gendergrads.org focuses on making your school safe for transgender and gender non-conforming youth. Get the tools to help your GSA raise awareness regarding gender identity and expression. Learn how to educate students and staff about gender non-conformity and transgender issues. Fight for policies at your school that provide strong protections for transgender and gender non-conforming youth.</p>
			<p>Challenge the gender binary system in schools!</p>
			<h3>Get educated about your rights</h3>
			<p>First, learn about the rights of transgender and gender non-conforming youth in Minnesota schools. Harassment and discrimination on the basis of gender identity and gender-related appearance or behavior is prohibited under Minnesota law.</p>
			<p>Learn how to file a complaint about harassment or discrimination based on gender identity or expression.</p>
			<p>Are transgender or gender non-conforming youth safe at your school? If your answer is no, then launch GSA Network’s Beyond the Binary Campaign.</p>
			<p><a href="#">Download our Beyond the Binary Campaign Guide (4 p.)</a></p>

			<h3 class="clear" >Get your campaign started</h3>
			<p>Change your school policy regarding gender identity. Make sure gender identity and expression are listed in your school’s non-discrimination policy. Go a step further and work to get your school to adopt the model policy for protecting transgender and gender non-conforming students that covers everything from bathrooms and locker rooms to dress codes and school records.</p>
			<p>Challenge the administration during prom, dances, and graduation. Make sure your administration allows students of any gender to run for the “King” or “Queen” of your prom or other school dances. Other school ceremonies, such as the color of your graduation gowns, are often gender-segregated. Learn how to fight back.</p>
			<p>Organize the Transgender Day of Remembrance. Participate in this annual event in November to memorialize those who were killed due to anti-transgender hatred or prejudice. Use the event to educate students, teachers, and administrators about transgender issues, so we can try to prevent anti-transgender hatred and violence from continuing.</p>
			<p>Conduct student trainings regarding gender issues. Educate your peers to understand more about gender issues, including learning important terminology and understanding the challenges faced by transgender and gender non-conforming youth at school.</p>
			<p>Provide teacher and staff trainings on gender awareness issues. Preventing discrimination from occurring in the ﬁrst place is one of the most effective ways to protect transgender and gender non-conforming students. Teachers and administrators at your school are required by law to prevent discrimination, but may not have the necessary information to do that effectively. So, train them!</p>
			<p>Fight for gender-neutral bathrooms. Campaign to get your school to designate a gender-neutral bathroom on campus. For example, your school can make a single-stall restroom accessible to students of any gender.</p>
			<p>Use visual activism or poster campaigns. Art activism is a powerful way of bringing attention to your cause. Your GSA can use buttons, T-shirts, ribbons, or stickers with messages and slogans that will encourage others to respect transgender students or challenge the gender binary. Consider if your GSA might also be able to display posters in teachers’ classrooms. You can start by getting some buttons or free posters from GSA Network.</p>
