			<h3 class="genderid">What is Gender?</h3>

			
			<p>Is gender just a matter of being male or female? Is gender only about the way you look and dress? Or is it also about how you see yourself and how that affects you? Gender is a combination of all these components.</p>

                            <h2>Gender Identity</h2>
                            <p><strong>Gender Identity</strong> refers to a person’s internal, deeply-felt sense of being either male, female, something other, or in between. Everyone has a gender identity. Some people have a gender identity that strongly conflicts with their biological sex — they are called transgender.

                            <h2>Attraction/Orientation</h2>
                            <p><strong>Sexual Orientation</strong> refers to a person’s emotional and sexual attraction to other people based on the gender of the other person. A person may identify their sexual orientation as heterosexual, lesbian, gay, bisexual, or queer. It is important to understand that sexual orientation and gender identity are two different things. Not all transgender youth identify as gay, lesbian, bisexual, or queer. And not all gay, lesbian, bisexual, and queer youth display gender non-conforming characteristics.

			<h4>Terminology</h4>
			<p>Gender is deﬁned and evaluated all around us. There are words that are associated with being a boy and others that are associated with being a girl. There are clothes that boys are expected to wear to prom, and clothes that girls are expected to wear to prom. There are sports that are considered “boys’” sports and sports that are considered “girls’” sports. Students who are gender non-conforming are those whose gender expression (or outward appearance) does not follow traditional gender roles: “feminine boys,” “masculine girls,” and students who are androgynous, for example. It can also include students who look the way boys and girls are expected to look but participate in activities that are gender nonconforming, like a boy who does ballet. The term “transgender youth” can be used as an umbrella term for all students whose gender identity is different from the sex they were assigned at birth and/or whose gender expression is non-stereotypical. Some transgender students transition or change from one gender to another. Transition often means changing the way you dress, selecting a new name, and sometimes getting help from a doctor to change your body.</p>
			<dl class="genderid">
				<dt>Transgender</dt><dd> is an umbrella term that can be used to describe people whose gender expression is nonconforming and/or whose gender identity is different from their birth assigned gender.</dd> 
				<dt>Transsexual</dt><dd> is a term most commonly used to refer to someone who transitions from one gender to another. It includes students who were identiﬁed as male at birth but whose gender identity is female, students who were identiﬁed as female at birth but whose gender identity is male, and students whose gender identity is neither male nor female. Transition often consists of a change in style of dress, selection of a new name, and a request that people use the correct pronoun when describing them. Transition may, but does not always, include necessary medical care like hormone therapy, counseling, and/or surgery.</dd>
				<dt>Gender non-conforming</dt><dd> refers to a person who is or is perceived to have gender characteristics and/or behaviors that do not conform to traditional or societal expectations. Gender non-conforming people may or may not identify as lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, or queer.</dd>
				<dt>Genderqueer</dt><dd> refers to people who do not identify as, or who do not express themselves as completely male or female. Genderqueer people may or may not identify as transgender.</dd> 
				<dt>LGBTQ</dt><dd> is an umbrella term that stands for “lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and questioning.” The category “questioning” is included to incorporate those that are not yet certain of their sexual orientation and/or gender identity.</dd>
				</dl>
			<h4>Truth &amp; Fiction</h4>
			<dl class="genderid">
			<dt>Myth:  Youth are not old enough to know their gender identity.</dt>
			<dd>Fact: Because of greater awareness about gender and transgender issues, more and more young people are becoming empowered to express their identity at young ages.</dd>
			<dt>Myth:  Youth are identifying as transgender just to be trendy.</dt>
			<dd>Fact:  Identifying as transgender brings with it challenges and often discrimination. It is not something people do to be cool. Like in many other areas of their life, some students may be exploring their gender expression and the labels they use to describe themselves. Such exploration is a normal part of adolescent development.</dd>
			<dt>Myth: Transgender youth deceive others about what their “true” gender is.</dt>
			<dd>Fact: Transgender people are not deceiving others by expressing their gender identity. For example, when a student transitions from male to female, she is expressing her true self to the world. She deserves to be recognized and respected like any other girl should be.</dd>
			<dt>Myth: Transgender and gender non-conforming students are actually gay.</dt>
			<dd>Fact:  Sexual orientation and gender identity are different. A person’s sexual orientation is related to whether the person is romantically attracted to men, women, or both. Gender identity, on the other hand, is about the person’s own internal identiﬁcation as male, female, or a gender in between male and female. Just like nontransgender people, transgender people can be of any sexual orientation.</dd>
			<dt>Myth:  All transgender youth will eventually take hormones and have sex reassignment surgery.</dt>
			<dd>Fact: Some transgender people take hormones and/or have surgery. However, for a number of reasons, many transgender people do not take either of these steps. Some feel comfortable with their bodies the way they are. For others, hormones and surgery are inaccessible because they may be too expensive and/or require parental permission. </dd>
			<dt>Myth: Transgender women are not “real” women and transgender men and not “real” men.</dt>
			<dd>Fact: People’s “true” gender is not deﬁned by the sex they were assigned at birth. Our true gender is based on our gender identity. When a person who is transgender expresses an identity different from the one they were assigned at birth, the gender they are expressing is their “real” gender.</dd>
